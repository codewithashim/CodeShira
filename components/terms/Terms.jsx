                You must follow any policies made available to you within the
                Services. Don't misuse our Services. For example, don't
                interfere with our Services or try to access them using a method
                other than the interface and the instructions that we provide.
                You may use our Services only as permitted by law, including
                applicable export and re-export control laws and regulations. We
                may suspend or stop providing our Services to you if you do not
                comply with our terms or policies or if we are investigating
                suspected misconduct. Using our Services does not give you
                ownership of any intellectual property rights in our Services or
                the content you access. You may not use content from our
                Services unless you obtain permission from its owner or are
                otherwise permitted by law. These terms do not grant you the
                right to use any branding or logos used in our Services. Don't
                remove, obscure, or alter any legal notices displayed in or
                along with our Services.

                  When you upload, submit, store, send or receive content to or
                  through our Services, you give Front (and those we work with)
                  a worldwide license to use, host, store, reproduce, modify,
                  create derivative works (such as those resulting from
                  translations, adaptations or other changes we make so that
                  your content works better with our Services), communicate,
                  publish, publicly perform, publicly display and distribute
                  such content. The rights you grant in this license are for the
                  limited purpose of operating, promoting, and improving our
                  Services, and to develop new ones. This license continues even
                  if you stop using our Services (for example, for a business
                  listing you have added to Front Maps). Some Services may offer
                  you ways to access and remove content that has been provided
                  to that Service. Also, in some of our Services, there are
                  terms or settings that narrow the scope of our use of the
                  content submitted in those Services.

                  Our Services are very diverse, so sometimes additional terms
                  or product requirements (including age requirements) may
                  apply. Additional terms will be available with the relevant
                  Services, and those additional terms become part of your
                  agreement with us if you use.
